* **List_of_supplementary_files.txt**: this list

* **Supplementary file 1**: Scaffolds and contigs removed from the *Heterorhabditis bacteriophora* assembly because of low coverage in the new whole genome sequencing dataset. Text file.

* **Supplementary File 2**: BRAKER1/soft-masked annotations of *Heterorhabditis bacteriophora*. A zipped archive (14.1 Mb) of the BRAKER1/soft-masked annotations of *Heterorhabditis bacteriophora*. The archive contains three text files: the GFF format file, the GTF format file and the amino acid sequences of the protein predictions in FASTA format.

* **Supplementary File 3**: BRAKER1/hard-masked annotations of *Heterorhabditis bacteriophora*. A zipped archive (13.4 Mb) of the BRAKER1/hard-masked annotations of *Heterorhabditis bacteriophora*. The archive contains three text files: the GFF format file, the GTF format file and the amino acid sequences of the protein predictions in FASTA format.

* **Supplementary File 4**: Comparison of the BRAKER1/soft-masked and BRAKER1/hard-masked gene predictions from *Heterorhabditis bacteriophora*. Tab-delimited text file.

* **Supplementary File 5**: OrthoFinder analyses of *Heterorhabditis bacteriophora* predicted proteomes. A zipped archive (20.3 Mb) of the OrthoFinder analyses of *Heterorhabditis bacteriophora* predicted proteomes with 23 other nematode species. The archive contains the following files:
    * **SF5.1** List of the proteomes included in the OrthoFinder analyses (text format file)
    * **SF5.2** List of *Heterorhabditis bacteriophora* proteins of length <30 amino acids excluded from the OrthoFinder analyses (text format file)
    * **SF5.3** The OrthoFinder output files. A zipped archive of the three OrthoFinder clustering result files (published *H. bacteriophora* + 23 species; BRAKER1/soft-masked + 23 species: published + soft-masked + 23 species).
    * **SF5.4** Table with count of orthogroups at each contribution ratio from the BRAKER1/soft-masked and published proteomes after clustering with 23 other Clade V nematodes. Empty cells denote contribution combinations with no orthogroups.
 
* **Supplementary File 6**: KinFin analyses of *Heterorhabditis bacteriophora* predicted proteomes. A zipped archive (27.8 Mb) of the KinFin analyses from the OrthoFinder analyses of *Heterorhabditis bacteriophora* predicted proteomes.

* **Supplementary File 7**: Phylogenetic analyses of *Heterorhabditis bacteriophora* predicted proteomes. A zipped archive (11.2 Mb) of the supermatrix alignment and the phylogenetic trees produced for the the analyses of the *Heterorhabditis bacteriophora* proteomes. The archive contains the following files:
    * **SF7.1** Alignments of orthogroups used to build the supermatrix (directory of aligned sequences in fasta format).
    * **SF7.2** Supermatrix of aligned sequences (FASTA .fas format file).
    * **SF7.3** Phylogenetic analysis output files (NEWICK format text file).
 
* **Supplementary File 8**: Secretome analyses of *Heterorhabditis bacteriophora* predicted proteomes. Secretome analyses of *Heterorhabditis bacteriophora* and other rhabditine nematodes. The zipped archive (8 kb) contains the following text format files.
    * **SF8.1** Secretome predictions from the published Bai et al. (2013) protein predictions.
    * **SF8.2** Secretome predictions from the BRAKER1/soft-masked predictions.
 
* **Supplementary File 9**: BRAKER1 and JIGSAW annotation pipelines. Figure illustrating the differences between the BRAKER1 and the Bai et al 2013 JIGSAW prediction methods used for *Heterorhabditis bacteriophora*. PDF file.
